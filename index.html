                    <h4>Within our messaging system, specific technical constraints are in place for effective
                        functionality. When composing a regular text message, users are limited to a maximum of 500
                        characters. For file and image attachments, the system allows for a total of 30 files to be sent
                        simultaneously, with an individual file size limit of 10 MB.
                        <br><br>
                        It's crucial to note that attempts to upload a file exceeding the 10 MB threshold will be
                        unsuccessful, in adherence to these constraints. Modification of these parameters can be
                        executed through the lib/utils/constants.dart file.
                        <br><br>
                        However, it's essential to acknowledge the backend's overarching limitations. The backend
                        enforces a maximum cap of 50 files per message and restricts individual file sizes to a maximum
                        of 2 GB. Consequently, any adjustments made within the app must align with these backend
                        constraints for seamless operation.

                    <p>
                        The Academics feature in e-School allows the admin to define the mediums (languages) in which
                        the school operates, such as English, Hindi, and Gujarati. Additionally, the admin can create
                        sections for classes, such as A, B, C, and so on.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <h3>Stream and Shifts</h3>
                    <p>
                        Streams are used to divide classes based on subject preferences, such as Arts, Commerce, or
                        Science. By creating streams, schools can offer specialized education and personalized learning
                        experiences.
                        <br>
                        Shifts are utilized to organize classes into different time-zones, like Morning or Afternoon, to
                        accommodate students' schedules. With shifts, schools can efficiently manage classroom
                        capacities and balance student-teacher ratios.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <h3>Subjects</h3>
                    <p>
                        The admin can create new subjects within e-School. Each subject can be associated with one of
                        the mediums and has a name, type (theory or practical), optional subject code, custom background
                        color, and image to be displayed in the application. This allows for easy organization and
                        identification of subjects across different classes.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <h3>Class</h3>
                    <p>
                        In e-School, the admin can add classes by choosing the mediums and sections that each class will
                        have. For example, selecting English as the medium and A, B, C as the sections will
                        automatically create classes like 10 A English, 10 B English, and 10 C English. Similarly,
                        selecting Gujarati as the medium and A, B, C as the sections will create classes like 10 A
                        Gujarati, 10 B Gujarati, and 10 C Gujarati. Optionally a shift can be chosen for any class to
                        indicate the time-zone it'll be taken on. There is also an option of sub-dividing classes into
                        streams based on student's subject preference.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Class Assign Subject</h3>
                    <p>
                        Each class can have one or more core and elective subjects assigned to it. The admin can assign
                        subjects to specific classes based on the curriculum requirements. This ensures that students in
                        each class have access to the appropriate subjects for their academic journey.

                    <p>
                        Teachers can be assigned as class teachers for one or more classes. The class teacher plays a
                        crucial role in overseeing the overall academic progress and discipline of the students in a
                        particular class. One teacher can be class teacher of multiple classes. The class teacher can
                        use
                        features like attendance to take attendance of students in their class and giving offline exam
                        Marks

                        Teachers are chosen to teach different subjects based on their expertise and qualifications. The
                        admin can assign subject teachers to specific subjects across different classes. This ensures
                        that students receive instruction from teachers who specialize in the respective subjects,
                        enhancing the quality of education.

                    <p>
                        The admin can use the this feature to assign a new student to a specific class and class
                        section. This feature allows for easy management of student enrollment and ensures that each
                        student is allocated to the appropriate class and section within the school.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Promote Student</h3>
                    <p>
                        The promote student feature allows for the seamless promotion of students from one class to
                        another at the end of the academic year. This simplifies the administrative process and ensures
                        that students progress to the appropriate next level in their education.

                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        The Dynamic Admission Form Field is a feature that simplifies students, parents and teachers enrollment. School
                        Admin can add their own form fields in students and parents admission forms and teacher form with various types like
                        textboxes, radio buttons, checkboxes, textareas, and file uploaders to suit the specific needs
                        of the schools, and making the admission process efficient and adaptable to changing needs.

                        students. They can provide details such as the student's first and last name, gender, profile

                        year. In this section, administrators can create new session years and manage existing ones.</p>
                    <p>When setting up a session year, administrators need to enter its name, starting date, ending
                        date, fees due date, and fees due charges (in percentage). Optionally, administrators can enable

                        charges (in percentage).</p>

                        section.</p>
                    <p>For instance, sports fees could be $90 for Class 9A and $200 for Class 12B. Administrators can
                        customize the amounts for individual fee types according to each class.</p>

                        section. If students and parents are making payments directly to the admin/principal using cash
                        or cheque, the admin can record those payments in the compulsory/optional fee payment section.
                    </p>
                    <p>Furthermore, administrators have the convenience of downloading PDF receipts for fees that have

                        make full payments for compulsory fees or, if installment options are enabled, pay one or more
                        installments. Additionally, they can pay optional fees at any time without concerns about due
                        charges.</p>
                    <p>In the settings -> fees transaction option, parents can review all fee payment transactions,
                        including the amount and status of each payment made.</p>
