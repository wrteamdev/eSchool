                        <h3>Mediums and Sections</h3>
                        <p>
                            The Academics feature in e-School allows the admin to define the mediums (languages) in
                            which
                            the school operates, such as English, Hindi, and Gujarati. Additionally, the admin can
                            create
                            sections for classes, such as A, B, C, and so on.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <h3>Stream and Shifts</h3>
                        <p>
                            Streams are used to divide classes based on subject preferences, such as Arts, Commerce, or
                            Science. By creating streams, schools can offer specialized education and personalized
                            learning
                            experiences.
                            <br>
                            Shifts are utilized to organize classes into different time-zones, like Morning or
                            Afternoon, to
                            accommodate students' schedules. With shifts, schools can efficiently manage classroom
                            capacities and balance student-teacher ratios.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <h3>Subjects</h3>
                        <p>
                            The admin can create new subjects within e-School. Each subject can be associated with one
                            of
                            the mediums and has a name, type (theory or practical), optional subject code, custom
                            background
                            color, and image to be displayed in the application. This allows for easy organization and
                            identification of subjects across different classes.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <h3>Class</h3>
                        <p>
                            In e-School, the admin can add classes by choosing the mediums and sections that each class
                            will
                            have. For example, selecting English as the medium and A, B, C as the sections will
                            automatically create classes like 10 A English, 10 B English, and 10 C English. Similarly,
                            selecting Gujarati as the medium and A, B, C as the sections will create classes like 10 A
                            Gujarati, 10 B Gujarati, and 10 C Gujarati. Optionally a shift can be chosen for any class
                            to
                            indicate the time-zone it'll be taken on. There is also an option of sub-dividing classes
                            into
                            streams based on student's subject preference.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <h3>Class Assign Subject</h3>
                        <p>
                            Each class can have one or more core and elective subjects assigned to it. The admin can
                            assign
                            subjects to specific classes based on the curriculum requirements. This ensures that
                            students in
                            each class have access to the appropriate subjects for their academic journey.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <h3>Assign Class Teacher</h3>
                        <p>
                            Teachers can be assigned as class teachers for one or more classes. The class teacher plays
                            a
                            crucial role in overseeing the overall academic progress and discipline of the students in a
                            particular class. One teacher can be class teacher of multiple classes. The class teacher
                            can
                            use
                            features like attendance to take attendance of students in their class and giving offline
                            exam
                            Marks
                            to the students in their class who has given the offline exam.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <h3>Assign Subject Teacher</h3>
                        <p>
                            Teachers are chosen to teach different subjects based on their expertise and qualifications.
                            The
                            admin can assign subject teachers to specific subjects across different classes. This
                            ensures
                            that students receive instruction from teachers who specialize in the respective subjects,
                            enhancing the quality of education.

                            The admin can use the this feature to assign a new student to a specific class and class
                            section. This feature allows for easy management of student enrollment and ensures that each
                            student is allocated to the appropriate class and section within the school.

                            another at the end of the academic year. This simplifies the administrative process and

                            The Student Admission section in the e-School web panel allows administrators to add new
                            students. They can provide details such as the student's first and last name, gender,
                            profile
                            image upload, class and category selection, caste, religion, blood group, height, current
                            and
                            permanent addresses. Additionally, administrators can add information about the student's
                            mother
                            and father, including their first names, last names, mobile number, profile image, email
                            addresses, date of birth, occupations, and genders. An optional guardian can also be added,
                            including similar details.
                            <br><br>
                            A student will be assigned a unique GR number automatically on admission. It will be used by
                            the
                            student to log in to the eSchool application with the date of birth (ddmmyyyy) as the
                            default
                            password. If new parents are created while admitting a new student, their email and date of
                            birth will be their parent login details for the eSchool application.

                            as first name, last name, gender, email, mobile number, optional profile image, date of

                            qualification, current address, and permanent address. Additionally, administrators have the
                            option to grant teachers permission to manage student and parent data, enabling them to
                            perform

                            make full payments for compulsory fees or, if installment options are enabled, pay one or
                            more
                            installments. Additionally, they can pay optional fees at any time without concerns about
                            due
                            charges.</p>

                            the student user and parent user will receive login credentials, allowing them to access

                            done, the system will automatically send the student's login credentials to the parents via
                            their registered email or ID. In the case of rejection, the parents will receive an email
